# MERN Social

## GIF support setup

To enable the Giphy picker, create a client/.env file with:

```
REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=your_giphy_api_key_here
```

Then restart the React dev server. The GIF button in comments opens a picker (MUI Dialog) that searches Giphy and inserts the selected GIF URL into your comment.
