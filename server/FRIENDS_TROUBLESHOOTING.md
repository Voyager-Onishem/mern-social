# Friends List Troubleshooting

## Issue: 404 Error when Accessing Friends List

If you're seeing a 404 error when trying to access a user's friends list, there might be issues with:

1. MongoDB connection
2. Invalid user ID
3. Invalid entries in the friends array

## Diagnosing the Issue

### 1. Check MongoDB Connection

First, make sure your MongoDB connection is working:

```
cd server
./check-mongo-connection.ps1
```

### 2. Check the User and Friends

Use the provided script to check if the user exists and has valid friends:

```
cd server
./check-user-friends.ps1 <userId>
```

Replace `<userId>` with the actual user ID you're trying to access (e.g., `68b1334cad0fe1731d60084d`).

This will:
- Verify the user exists in the database
- List all friends in the user's friends array
- Check if each friend exists
- Check if friendships are mutual

### 3. Fix Invalid Friends

If there are invalid entries in the friends array, use this script to clean it up:

```
cd server
./fix-user-friends.ps1 <userId>
```

## Code Improvements

The following improvements have been made to prevent future issues:

1. Added better error handling in the `getUserFriends` controller
2. Added validation of user IDs and friend IDs
3. Added checks for non-existent users and empty friend arrays
4. Added debugging logs to help identify issues
5. Improved the client-side code to handle errors gracefully

## Client-Side Changes

The FriendListWidget component has been updated to:
1. Display loading state
2. Show error messages if the API call fails
3. Log detailed information about the API request
4. Fall back to a default API URL if the environment variable is not set
