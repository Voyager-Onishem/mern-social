# MERN Social - Frontend Feature Audit (Continued)

## 7. Engagement Metrics Implementation Details

### Profile Views & Post Impressions (Phase 1 Complete)

**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Backend counters implemented

#### Phase 1 Implementation (2025-09-26)
- Added `profileViewsTotal` counter to `User` model (increment-only, non-unique)
- Added `impressions` counter (default 0) to `Post` model (increment-only)
- New analytics endpoints established:
  - POST /analytics/profile-view { profileUserId }
  - POST /analytics/post-impressions { postIds: [] }
  - GET /analytics/profile/:id/summary
  - GET /analytics/post/:id/summary
- JWT validation with self-view exclusion
- BulkWrite optimization for impressions

#### Future Phases Roadmap
- **Phase 2**: Uniqueness handling, client-side deduplication, time-window suppression
- **Phase 3**: Viewer list with privacy controls, metrics breakdown
- **Phase 4**: Analytics dashboards, trends, daily aggregation
- **Phase 5**: Anomaly detection and monitoring alerts

#### Frontend Implementation Plan
1. **Profile Page**:
   - POST analytics/profile-view on mount
   - Display counters with tooltip explanation
   - Optional viewer chips with timeAgo formatting

2. **Feed Components**:
   - Track post visibility with IntersectionObserver
   - Debounced batch reporting (1-2s intervals)
   - Optimistic Redux updates for impression counts

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Session-based deduplication with Set
   - Batch size limiting (max 50 IDs)
   - Non-blocking fire-and-forget requests

## 8. Technical Details & Architecture

### Real-time Implementation

**Current Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED with enhancements planned

#### Currently Working
- SSE endpoint with 5 event types (post:new, post:like, comment:add/edit/delete)
- Auto-subscription after authentication
- Live Redux updates (new posts prepended, mutations merged)
- Heartbeat detection and silence monitoring
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Event batching with 250ms coalescing window

#### Potential Improvements
- Selective subscriptions by friend or post visibility
- Presence and typing indicators
- WebSocket upgrade for bidirectional features
- Client-side versioning for out-of-order events
- Connection monitoring and diagnostics

### Security & Resilience

**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Basic protections in place

#### Current Implementation
- JWT authentication with proper storage
- Bearer token usage (appropriate for SPA)
- Embed sanitization with restricted permissions
- Global error boundary for crash prevention

#### Needed Improvements
- Client-side rate limiting/throttling
- More comprehensive error logging/monitoring
- Stronger content security policy
- Enhanced iframe sandbox rules

## 9. Code Cleanup Opportunities

1. **Mobile Overflow Menu**: `MoreHorizOutlined` component without expanded actions
2. **Legacy Media Paths**: `picturePath` usage now duplicative of `mediaPaths` system
3. **GIF/Video Extraction**: Limited to first occurrence in some places
4. **Error Handling Patterns**: Various approaches across components
5. **Media Processing Logic**: Should be consolidated into shared utilities

---

## 10. Implementation Success Metrics

For engagement features:
- < 50ms average server latency per batch call
- Accuracy within ±1 for impression counts
- Maximum 1 analytics request per 2 seconds during normal scrolling

For real-time features:
- < 500ms end-to-end latency for event propagation
- 99.9% event delivery rate
- < 1% CPU overhead from SSE processing

## 11. Summary & Recommendations

### Status Overview (Updated October 20, 2025)
| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|:------:|-------|
| Core posting | ✅ | Text, media, audio fully functional |
| Authentication | ✅ | Login, registration, protected routes |
| Comments | ✅ | Add, edit, delete with optimistic updates |
| Real-time | ⚠️ | Basic SSE working, enhancements needed |
| Media handling | ⚠️ | Single file only, needs carousel |
| Sharing | ❌ | UI exists but non-functional |
| Deep linking | ❌ | No dedicated post routes |
| Mobile experience | ⚠️ | Basic responsiveness, needs optimization |
| Accessibility | ⚠️ | Some ARIA added, more work needed |

### Priority Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fixes (1-3 days)**
   - Share functionality with progressive enhancement
   - Post deep links for shareable content
   - Media carousel for multiple attachments

2. **Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)**
   - Pagination or infinite scroll
   - Enhanced mobile experience
   - Audio player improvements

3. **Medium-term Projects (2-4 weeks)**
   - Cloud storage integration
   - Complete analytics implementation
   - Enhanced real-time features

No evidence of over-engineering was found in the codebase. The audio recording feature is self-contained, test mocks are appropriate, and abstraction layers are reasonable for the application's complexity.
