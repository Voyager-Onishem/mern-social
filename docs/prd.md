# MERN Social - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

MERN Social is a full-stack responsive social media application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform enables users to create accounts, share posts with text, images, videos, and audio content, interact through likes and comments, and connect with friends in a real-time social environment.

## Current Features

### Core Functionality

- **Social Interactions**: Like posts, add/edit/delete comments with real-time updates
- **Feed System**: Timeline view of posts from users and friends
- **Profile Management**: View profiles, update location/occupation, friend connections
- **Search**: Find users and posts by name, location, or occupation
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-sent events (SSE) for live post/comment updates with polling fallback
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode toggle
- **Media Upload**: Local file storage with Cloudinary integration option

### Technical Features
- **Responsive Design**: Material-UI components with mobile-first approach
- **File Upload**: Multer-based uploads with format validation (images, videos, audio)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **API Architecture**: RESTful endpoints with Express.js
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for client-side state
- **Error Handling**: Global error boundaries and user feedback
- **Analytics**: Profile view and post impression tracking

## Target Audience

- **Primary Users**: Social media enthusiasts seeking a streamlined posting experience
- **Secondary Users**: Content creators who need multimedia sharing capabilities
- **Technical Users**: Developers interested in MERN stack implementations

## Success Metrics

- User engagement (likes, comments, profile views)
- Content creation volume (posts per user)
- Platform retention (daily/weekly active users)
- Technical performance (load times, uptime)

## Planned Enhancements

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
- **Share Functionality**: Implement Web Share API with clipboard fallback
- **Multiple Media Upload**: Gallery/carousel support for multiple files per post
- **Friend Management UI**: Complete add/remove friend functionality
- **Profile Enhancement**: Avatar/bio editing, social media links
- **Embed Removal**: Explicit UI buttons to remove embedded content

### Medium Priority
- **Advanced Search**: Filter by date, media type, engagement metrics
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for interactions
- **Content Moderation**: Basic filtering and reporting system
- **Performance Optimization**: Image compression, lazy loading, caching
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive ARIA support, keyboard navigation

### Long-term Vision
- **Groups/Communities**: Interest-based group creation and management
- **Direct Messaging**: Private messaging between users
- **Stories**: Instagram-style ephemeral content
- **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior insights, content performance
- **Mobile App**: React Native companion application

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React 18 with hooks and functional components
- Material-UI for consistent design system
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Responsive design with mobile optimization
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js framework
- MongoDB database with Mongoose schemas
- JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Multer for file upload handling
- Real-time capabilities with Server-Sent Events

### Infrastructure
- Cloud storage integration (Cloudinary)
- Environment-based configuration
- Error logging and monitoring
- Database connection resilience (Atlas/local fallback)

## Constraints and Assumptions

- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- **Device Support**: Desktop and mobile web browsers
- **Storage Limits**: 25MB per file upload
- **Authentication**: Email/password based (OAuth planned)
- **Data Privacy**: Basic user data protection (GDPR considerations for future)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **File Storage Migration**: Moving from local to cloud storage
- **Real-time Performance**: SSE connection management at scale
- **Media Compatibility**: Cross-browser video/audio support

### Business Risks
