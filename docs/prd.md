CR4: External integrations (Giphy, Cloudinary) must continue functioning

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

New UI elements will follow the established Material-UI design patterns, using the existing theme system with light/dark mode support. Components will integrate with the current Redux state management and maintain responsive design principles. The enhancement will extend existing component libraries rather than replace them.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

- Search results with advanced filters and pagination
- Notification panel in navigation
- Enhanced search interface with filter options
- Notification preferences dialog

### UI Consistency Requirements

All new UI elements must use the existing color palette, typography scale, and spacing system. Interactive elements shall follow established hover/focus states. Loading states and error handling shall use existing skeleton loaders and snackbar notifications.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
**Frameworks**: React 18, Express.js, Node.js
**Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
**Infrastructure**: Local file storage + Cloudinary CDN
**External Dependencies**: Material-UI, Redux Toolkit, Multer, JWT, bcrypt

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Mongoose schemas with backward-compatible migrations
**API Integration Strategy**: Add new endpoints alongside existing REST API structure
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing React components with new features
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Expand existing Jest/Mocha test suites

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing src/components, src/scenes, server/routes patterns
**Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
**Coding Standards**: ESLint configuration, async/await patterns, error handling
**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc for functions, README updates for features

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing npm scripts and Create React App build
**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain current PM2/Nginx setup with environment configs
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing Morgan logging and error tracking
**Configuration Management**: Environment variables for new features (notification preferences, etc.)

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: SSE connection scaling for notifications, cloud storage migration complexity
**Integration Risks**: Breaking existing functionality during enhancements, API compatibility issues
**Deployment Risks**: Database migration failures, environment configuration errors
**Mitigation Strategies**: Incremental testing, feature flags, rollback procedures, comprehensive QA

## Epic and Story Structure

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic for all enhancements because they are interconnected platform improvements that share the same technical foundation and user experience goals.

## Epic 1: MERN Social Platform Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Complete the remaining high-value features for the MERN Social platform including advanced search, real-time notifications, and cloud storage migration.

**Integration Requirements**: All changes must integrate seamlessly with existing authentication, real-time updates, and storage systems.
